                Everybody loves feedback. And statistics. During the conference, we collected feedback both physically in form of post-its after your talk, and online, in form of ratings on a few different areas: relevance, content, quality and overall.
                We have compiled this feedback and tried to present it to you in a more structured manner, which hopefully will give you some input on how others saw your performance.

                Please <a href="/contact.html">let us know</a> if anything is unclear, or if you miss something. We hope you can put this to good use, and that we'll see you again next year for another JavaZone. We'll certainly give you a heads up before the "Call for Speakers" opens.

                JavaZone is a conference arranged by volunteers, and we believe in sharing of knowledge and making information available to everyone. This is why we release videos of each talk just after (or, during, actually) the conference, completely for free.

                Your talk is at {your talk} â€“ feel free to share it as much as you'd like. You'll also find some statistics on this page: click the <span class="stats-button">Stats</span> button just below the description, and you will see total plays, likes, and comments among others.
