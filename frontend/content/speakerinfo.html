    <h1>So, you're a speaker!</h1>
    <p>With JavaZone 2015 quickly approaching, it's time to go over a few details to ensure you are ready. If you are having a workshop, lightning speech or presentation, this is for you.</p>

            <h2>The essentials</h2>
            <p>By now, you probably have all the essentials in place – traveling tickets if you come from out of town, and hotel. If not, it's probably a good idea to get this fixed.</p>
            <h2>Your talk</h2>
            <p>Your talk is listed in <a href="/program.html">the program</a>. It is a good idea to find out when you are up already now. You should also read through the info listed to ensure that everything is correct.</p>
            <h2>Guided tour</h2>
            <p>Never been to JavaZone, or just curious to see the venue? We will have a guided tour for speakers at Tuesday September 8th, 18:00. Meet us at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oslo+Spektrum/@59.912985,10.754742,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46416e61cee4e1bf:0xeaab41e737da924c?hl=en|https://www.google.com/maps/place/Oslo+Spektrum/@59.912985,10.754742,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x46416e61cee4e1bf:0xeaab41e737da924c?hl=en" target="_blank">the main entrance</a></p>
            <h2>Backups</h2>
            <p>You never know what might happen, so it is always a good idea to keep a backup of your talk somewhere <em>else</em> than your computer – memory stick, Dropbox or something similiar.</p>

                <p class="practicality practicality-location">
                    As always, JavaZone takes place at Oslo Spektrum in the heart of Oslo. If this doesn't tell you anything – don't worry, finding Oslo Spektrum won't be too hard. You can use use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Current+Location/Oslo+Spektrum,+Sonja+Henies+plass+2,+0185+Oslo,+Norway/">this Google Maps link</a> to get directions from your current location to Oslo Spektrum, or use the <a href="https://reiseplanlegger.ruter.no/en">travel planner</a> with Oslo Spektrum as your destination for public transport. Oh, and if you're completely lost, don't be afraid to ask! Most norwegians are quite friendly.
                </p>
                <h2>Where do I stay?</h2>
                <p class="practicality practicality-hotels">
                    There's plenty of hotels in the area surrounding the conference center. Searching for hotels close to "Oslo Central Station" is a good tip, and should give you a few alternatives to choose from.
                </p>
                <h2>Food and drinks</h2>
                <p class="practicality practicality-foods">
                    Learning makes you hungry, and we are of course well aware of this. This is why we have a constant stream of food throughout the whole day, prepared by professional chefs from The Flying Culinary Circus. Believe us, if there is one thing you will not be missing at JavaZone, it is food.
                </p>
                <h2>I don't speak norwegian…</h2>
                <p class="practicality practicality-language">
                    Don't worry! About 60% of the talks are  held in english, and the spoken language is specified in <a href="/program.html">the program</a>. So even if you don't "snakker norsk", you should still get plenty of learning out of the conference.

                <p>JavaZone has a few different presentation formats – full presentations, lightning talks and workshops. This means that you should have something nice to attend both when you just want a little teaser, and when you're in for the full package.</p>
