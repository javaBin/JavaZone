    <p class="ingress">JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers. The conference has been held in Oslo for 12 consecutive years.</p>
    <p>The conference is not possible without the involvement and support of our partners. Each year, a lot of partners attend JavaZone and set up a stand for their company in our exhibition space. The exhibitions area at JavaZone is placed in the center of the conference hall, and there are always a lot of people hanging around, mingling and eating there, making this the perfect area to meet both new and old coworkers.</p>
    <p>Our partners also get reduced prices on the tickets for JavaZone, and most send quite a lot of their people to JavaZone to enjoy the wonderful learning-opportunity our many speakers present.</p>

    <p>We would love to see you and your company at JavaZone 2014!</p>
