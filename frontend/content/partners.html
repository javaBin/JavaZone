		<h1>What is JavaZone?</h1>
		<p>JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers. The conference has been held in Oslo for 13 consecutive years.</p>

		<p>Last year, we had around 2,500 attendees at the conference, including speakers, volunteers and around 100 representatives from our partners. At JavaZone 2015, we estimate that there will be around the same number of participants.</p>

		<p>We would not be able to arrange a conference of this size and quality without the involvement and support of every one of our partners. Each year, between 40 and 50 partners contributes to make JavaZone a great success.</p>

		<h1>What does a partnership involve?</h1>
		<p>All companies are given the same option to become a partner; there is no bronze, silver or gold partnerships – everyone are treated as equals. There are however options to increase the size of the stand or buy in on one of our restaurant or concept stands. We strive to make the expo area a thriving and dynamic location for participants and partners.</p>

		<p>The expo area at JavaZone is placed in the center of the conference hall, making this the perfect area to meet all the participants. To make a dynamic and vibrant place, we have found that shorter breaks between sessions, and the concept of serving food continuously throughout the conference from partner stands located in this same area, is key. This means that partners with stands in the expo area are given the opportunity of quite a lot of visitors throughout the day. At the same time, this makes the expo area a perfect place to hang out for the conference guests.</p>

		<p>You can find more information and prices in the slides from our first partner meeting. They are availiable in both norwegian and english. Please <a href="<%= settings.partner_mail %>">get in touch</a> to discuss with us if you need any more information.</p>
