    <p>JavaZone is a conference organized by and for a great community of developers. The conference is not possible without the involvement and support of our partners, buying both stands and tickets for their employees to the conference. In addition to gaining access to the exhibition area we involve our partners in both forming the agenda of and the conference itself.</p>

    <p>In the exhibition space, we have organized a range of activities, from whiteboards, where speakers can expand on their presentations and answer questions arising from the presentation, to music and stand-up performances.</p>
