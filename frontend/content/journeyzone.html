            <p>
                Are you a speaker at JavaZone 2015? Then this is the trip for you! JourneyZone has become kind of an annual tradition at JavaZone – when the conference is over, we invite all of our speakers to join us on an adventure. This year, the trip goes to Svalbard – the northern norwegian archipelago.
            </p>
            <h2>When and where?</h2>
            <p>We start the journey the day after JavaZone, and will be back in Oslo by Monday September 14th.</p>
            <h2>Who can attend?</h2>
            <p>
                All speakers of JavaZone is invited, but we have a limited number of spots for the journey. Speakers who hold 60 minute presentations and workshop holders are prioritized, but presenters of lightning talks are more than welcome to apply – just know that we probably can't fit everyone.

            <p>We have a tightly packed program for the whole journey – our goal is to see as much of Svalbard as possible in four days. This is our tentative plan, but we're sure we'll add in more stuff here and there as well.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Friday, September 11th:</strong> We leave Oslo by plane from Oslo Airport Gardermoen at 09.00, and arrive at Longyearbyen. We'll have some time to explore the town, but be aware: don't walk outside the town – the signs with an polar bear on then isn't just for show! We'll spend the first night at <a href="http://basecampexplorer.com/spitsbergen/hotels/basecamp-hotel">Basecamp Hotel</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Saturday, September 12th:</strong> Rise and shine, we'll eat a good breakfast, and then we set sail for the sea (or, more correct: "set motor"). We'll split in three groups, and go by a polarcircle boat for a few hours, until we end up at Isfjord Radio. We'll explore the area, learn about the local bird life, and end the night with a 3-course dinner. We'll spend the night at <a href="http://basecampexplorer.com/spitsbergen/hotels/isfjord-radio">Isfjord Radio</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunday, September 13th:</strong> No time to sleep in, we'll start the day early and go on a hiking trip around the area. We'll have guides with us, both because they know the history of the area and can tell us all about it, but also because we need protection in case we meet polar bears. No kidding. In the evening, we'll go by boat back to Longyearbyen. We'll spend the night there, trying out the local pub.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday, September 14th:</strong> Finally, a day you can either sleep in, or more smart: spend on exploring the area by yourself. Our plane leaves at 12.40, and we'll be back at Oslo Airport Gardermoen 15.35.</li>

        <h1 class="section-header">Practicalities</h1>
        <div class="section-content">
            <p>You should really read this list, to make sure that everything goes as smoothly as possible...</p>
            <h2>Visa and passport</h2>
            <p>
                All travellers to Svalbard need to go through the passport control. The identity of all travellers between Svalbard and the Norwegian mainland will be checked both upon arrival and departure. If you need a visa to arrive to Norway, please note that <strong>you need a second visa</strong> to enter Norway again after your trip to Spitsbergen.
            </p>
            <h2>Physical fitness</h2>
            <p>
                We'll do our best to make sure that anyone can join the trip. That being said, there will be some things that can be <strong>physically heavy</strong>: the boattrip to Isfjord Radio being one example. Please let us know if you have back pains, a heart condition or any other situation we should try to accomodate for.
            </p>
            <h2>Security when spending time on your own</h2>
            <p>
                We'll mostly spend time together, but will also have some "alone time". In Longyearbyen you can walk around on your own. On both sides of the settlement there are polar bear signs making sure everyone entering the wilderness has proper safety equipment with them. <strong>Do not wander past those signs</strong> without an experienced guide and rifle.
            </p>
            <h2>Personal expenses</h2>
            <p>
                JavaZone pays for almost the whole trip, this is considered the reward for holding your talk at the conference. But we'll need all participants to provide <strong>a deductible of NOK 2000</strong> to attend the trip.
            </p>
            <h2>More info? Questions?</h2>
            <p>
                We'll give you a lot more informations when we get closer to the trip. Until then, feel free to ask us anything by emailing us at <a href="mailto:javazone@java.no">javazone@jeve.no</a>.
