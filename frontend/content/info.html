			<h1 class="section-header">A few practicalities</h1>
			<div class="section-content">
				<h2>Location, location, location..</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-location">
					As always, JavaZone takes place at Oslo Spektrum in the heart of Oslo. If this doesn't tell you anything – don't worry, finding Oslo Spektrum won't be too hard. You can use use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Current+Location/Oslo+Spektrum,+Sonja+Henies+plass+2,+0185+Oslo,+Norway/">this link</a> to get directions from your current location to Oslo Spektrum, or use the <a href="https://reiseplanlegger.ruter.no/en">travel planner</a> with Oslo Spektrum as your destination for public transport. Ohh, and if you're completely lost, don't be afraid to ask! Most norwegians are quite friendly.
				</p>
				<h2>Food and drinks</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-foods">
					Learning makes you hungry, and we are of course well aware of this. This is why we have a constant stream of food throughout the whole day, prepared by professional chefs from [insert chefs here!]. Believe us, if there is one thing you will not be missing at JavaZone, it is food.
				</p>
				<h2>Where do I stay?</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-hotels">
					There's plenty of hotels in the area surrounding the conference center. Searching for hotels close to "Oslo Central Station" is a good tip, and should give you a few alternatives to choose from.
				</p>
				<h2>I don't speak norwegian..</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-language">
					Don't worry! About 50% of the talks are typically held in english, and the spoken language is always specified in the program. You should still get plenty of learning out of the conference.
