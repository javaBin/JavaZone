			<div class="section-content">
				<h2>Location, location, location..</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-location">
					As always, JavaZone takes place at Oslo Spektrum in the heart of Oslo. If this doesn't tell you anything – don't worry, finding Oslo Spektrum won't be too hard. You can use use <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Current+Location/Oslo+Spektrum,+Sonja+Henies+plass+2,+0185+Oslo,+Norway/">this Google Maps link</a> to get directions from your current location to Oslo Spektrum, or use the <a href="https://reiseplanlegger.ruter.no/en">travel planner</a> with Oslo Spektrum as your destination for public transport. Oh, and if you're completely lost, don't be afraid to ask! Most norwegians are quite friendly.
				</p>
				<h2>Where do I stay?</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-hotels">
					There's plenty of hotels in the area surrounding the conference center. Searching for hotels close to "Oslo Central Station" is a good tip, and should give you a few alternatives to choose from.
				</p>
				<h2>Food and drinks</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-foods">
					Learning makes you hungry, and we are of course well aware of this. This is why we have a constant stream of food throughout the whole day, prepared by professional chefs from The Flying Culinary Circus. Believe us, if there is one thing you will not be missing at JavaZone, it is food.
				</p>
				<h2>I don't speak norwegian…</h2>
				<p class="practicality practicality-language">
					Don't worry! About 60% of the talks are  held in english, and the spoken language is specified in <a href="/program.html">the program</a>. So even if you don't "snakker norsk", you should still get plenty of learning out of the conference.

				<h2>The different formats</h2>
				<p>JavaZone has a few different presentation formats – full presentations, lightning talks and workshops. This means that you should have something nice to attend both when you just want a little teaser, and when you're in for the full package.</p>
