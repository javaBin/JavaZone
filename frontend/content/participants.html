		<h2 class="first"><i class="icon-bullhorn"></i> Information for speakers</h2>
		<p>JavaZone is nothing without all our wonderful speakers who are holding full tracks, lightning talks or workshops. To help you help us make this years conference the best for both you and all the other guests, we have collected a bunch of information here. If there is anything else, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>

		<p>The or­gan­iser of Java­Zone is jav­aBin (the Nor­we­gian Java User Group), an in­de­pen­dent, non-profit or­ga­ni­za­tion. The con­fer­ence has part­ners but no spon­sors. The agenda is de­fined by the Pro­gram Com­mit­tee with­out ex­ter­nal in­ter­fer­ence. This in­de­pen­dence is part of what makes Java­Zone so unique. We there­fore have a lim­ited bud­get for re­im­burs­ing con­fer­ence speak­ers. Please see our <a href="/monetarypolicy.html">mon­e­tary pol­icy</a> for more in­for­ma­tion.</p>

		<p>To get a feel for what content we have featured on previous conferencec, you can look at <a href="/toptalks.html">the top talks of JavaZone 2013</a>.</p>

		<p>Speak­ers with ac­cepted <strong>pre­sen­ta­tions</strong> will get free ad­mis­sion to the con­fer­ence.
		  They will also be in­vited to the speak­ers din­ner and can join us on <a href="journeyzone.html">Jour­ney­Zone</a>, an epic journey in the Norwegian wilderness. Speak­ers with ac­cepted <strong>light­ning talks</strong> will be in­vited to the speak­ers din­ner but will have to pay for their own ad­mis­sion to Java­Zone.</p>
