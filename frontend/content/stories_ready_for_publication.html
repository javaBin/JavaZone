						What I love most about JavaZone is the conversations. The sessions are great, and I love creating and presenting new talks for JavaZone, but it's the people you bump into in and around the exhibitor stands, in between and during sessions. I always learn something new: sometimes it's in a session; sometimes it's between sessions; sometimes it's from someone I know; sometimes it's from someone new to me or who I've just met; sometimes it's about something in Java or elsewhere in the Java space; sometimes it's about something in software development outside the Javaverse.
