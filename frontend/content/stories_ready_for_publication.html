						I have been doing lighting talks three of the last four years attending JavaZone. Doing a lightning talk is much less scary than doing a full hour-long presentation. You get to present your favourite subjects, try out your presentation skills and you get valuable feedback. I encourage anyone to try it!
					</p>
					<p>
						For me one of the most interesting presentations in this year’s JavaZone was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=483e15ab">"I-Tier: Breaking Up The Monolith"</a> by Brian McAllister from Groupon. I especially liked gaining insight in how their architectural decisions was carried out in a large and distributed organisation. I also enjoyed <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=96a5fd40">"Practical Considerations for Micro Service Architectures"</a> by Sam Newman for providing valuable tips and Nathaniel Schutta's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=6038cb37">"Mind the Gap: Architecting UIs in the Era of Diverse Devices"</a> for showing exactly how hard it is to test your apps on the multitude of devices out there.

						JavaZone is to me a kind of industry party where you meet colleagues you haven't seen for a while. It was nice to walk around talking to both known and unknown people. As usual JavaZone had put together a very strong program.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite talks was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=cce167fb">"Continuous Delivery for Architects"</a> by Neal Ford. A very well-organised talk describing many important principles of Continuous delivery and Micro Services at a fairly general level. A must see, if you want a good introduction to the topic. I would also like to highlight a fun and different talk on mathematics that challenges common sense and intuition. The talk has no direct relevance to IT, but it challenges how we look at problems in everyday life and it shows why the most intuitive solutions often are not the right ones: <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=666d19fe">“Kontroversiell matematikk”</a> by Christian Magnus Berg

						As a first-time JavaZone visitor I met a firework of impressions. Kudos to JavaBin for the fantastic format; everything was centered around the show floor, never a long way to the sessions. A very good spread of talks, consistent high quality, some variations in presentation skills, but overall very good.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite talks was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=483e15ab">"I-Tier: Breaking Up the Monolith"</a> by Brian McCallister. In a delightfully humorous and ironic manner Brian showed us the road that Groupon had travelled, breaking down the monolith to small and manageable subsystems. Lots of good examples of what went bad and what went well. Another favourite was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=9b99aad3">"The Adventurous Developer's guide to Application Servers"</a> by Simon Maple. A really energetic and dynamic talk on selecting application servers. He was passionate and had plenty of good documentation underway, clearly having properly tested the different alternatives, presenting everything in a good way.

						I have attended javazone ever since 2004. Not only is it an important source of competence for me – it is also an alumni where I meet people in the business for gossip and a party!
					</p>
					<p>
						In my view, the conference was instrumental in the tremendous competence lift we had in industry in the Oslo Area during the 2000’s.  From the get-go, JavaZone encouraged local talent to talk alongside with international celebrities. This had a very positive effect on the local java-community: People who could find innovative solutions and identify best practices – and share them – were awarded with fame and peer recognition. As as side effect, many people think of it as a bit daunting. But with the right preparations and coaching it can be a very exciting and rewarding experience - at least it was for me!
					</p>
					<p>
						I have given two talks at javaZone: In 2013 I was allowed to present our local initiative to <a href="http://jz13.java.no/presentation.html?id=359cd17a">teach children coding</a>, and last year I gave a presentation about the current state of <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=a3976bdb">“The Internet of Things”</a>. The people who work behind the scenes are very professional and helpful. I can attest to the quality of the service, since I had rather special needs last year, with a plastic skull, two Arduinos and a Raspberry PI that needed a network connection. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Two of my favourite presentations in 2014 were Per Jørgen Walstrøm about how he made <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=72157526">camels dance (duh.. Camel the integration framework)</a> and Jeff Genender about how <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=8a6cfc53">"Building a Country on Open Source Java"</a> – in Ecuador. It makes me wonder what would be possible here in Norway

						What I love most about JavaZone is the conversations. The sessions are great, and I love creating and presenting new talks for JavaZone, but it's the people you bump into in and around the exhibitor stands, in between and during sessions. I always learn something new: sometimes it's in a session; sometimes it's between sessions; sometimes it's from someone I know; sometimes it's from someone new to me or who I've just met; sometimes it's about something in Java or elsewhere in the Java space; sometimes it's about something in software development outside the Javaverse.

						JavaZone is a great place to meet some of the brightest minds in the business. With their wide range of lectures, they offer something for everyone, whether you’re interested in improving your programming skills or succeeding with continuous delivery. It provides a great setting for broadening your horizon and getting inspired.
					</p>
					<p>Amongst the many great lectures in 2014, one of my favourites was “<a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=96a5fd40">Practical Considerations For Microservice Architectures</a>” by Sam Newman, where he eloquently describes the benefits and challenges associated with distributed applications. Additionally, Sam shares in his experiences with deploying services independently. Sam manages to explain complex solutions in terms that everyone can relate to, independent of their experience level.</p> 
					<p>Another favourite was “<a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=38ae33c2">Understanding Java byte code</a>” by Rafael Winterhalter. Rafael gives a comprehensible introduction to byte code manipulation, and forms the basis for using class transformers to manipulate and deploy byte code in running applications. A field that becomes more and more interesting as a tool to eliminate excessive boilerplate code and increase portability.</p>
