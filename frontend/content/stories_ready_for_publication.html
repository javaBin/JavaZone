						I have been doing lighting talks three of the last four years attending JavaZone. Doing a lightning talk is much less scary than doing a full hour-long presentation. You get to present your favourite subjects, try out your presentation skills and you get valuable feedback. I encourage anyone to try it!
					</p>
					<p>
						For me one of the most interesting presentations in this year’s JavaZone was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=483e15ab">"I-Tier: Breaking Up The Monolith"</a> by Brian McAllister from Groupon. I especially liked gaining insight in how their architectural decisions was carried out in a large and distributed organisation. I also enjoyed <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=96a5fd40">"Practical Considerations for Micro Service Architectures"</a> by Sam Newman for providing valuable tips and Nathaniel Schutta's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=6038cb37">"Mind the Gap: Architecting UIs in the Era of Diverse Devices"</a> for showing exactly how hard it is to test your apps on the multitude of devices out there.

						JavaZone is to me a kind of industry party where you meet colleagues you haven't seen for a while. It was nice to walk around talking to both known and unknown people. As usual JavaZone had put together a very strong program.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite talks was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=cce167fb">"Continuous Delivery for Architects"</a> by Neal Ford. A very well-organised talk describing many important principles of Continuous delivery and Micro Services at a fairly general level. A must see, if you want a good introduction to the topic. I would also like to highlight a fun and different talk on mathematics that challenges common sense and intuition. The talk has no direct relevance to IT, but it challenges how we look at problems in everyday life and it shows why the most intuitive solutions often are not the right ones: <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=666d19fe">“Kontroversiell matematikk”</a> by Christian Magnus Berg

						What I love most about JavaZone is the conversations. The sessions are great, and I love creating and presenting new talks for JavaZone, but it's the people you bump into in and around the exhibitor stands, in between and during sessions. I always learn something new: sometimes it's in a session; sometimes it's between sessions; sometimes it's from someone I know; sometimes it's from someone new to me or who I've just met; sometimes it's about something in Java or elsewhere in the Java space; sometimes it's about something in software development outside the Javaverse.
