		<h1 class="section-header">Format and duration</h1>
		<div class="section-content">
			<p>You should think about which format your talk will work best in. Are you presenting a new idea or pitching a small topic, or do you need more time to elaborate on your idea? How hands-on do you want to be? We have three formats you can present your material in</p>
			<h2>Lightning talks (10 minutes)</h2>
			<p>Are you presenting a great new idea, or want to give the audience a teaser for a cool topic? Then you should strongly consider the lightning format.</p>
			<h2>Presentations (60 minutes)</h2>
			<p>All presentations at JavaZone have a length of 60 minutes. This gives you room to elaborate on an idea in detail, and also spend a little time at the end taking questions. We are considering double slots for special topics, so if you feel you need more than 60 minutes, please contact us.</p>
			<h2>Workshops (2 hours, half a day, whole day)</h2>
			<p>We will continue the popular workshop concept, both half-day and whole-day workshops on Tuesday September 9th and shorter 2-hour workshops during the conference. The format for the workshops is in-depth, hands-on and interactive.</p>

		<div class="section-content">
			<p>The audience at JavaZone consists mostly of software developers and generally talks and workshops should be technical enough that they include code (although that is not a requirement). Talks purely related to practices (agile etc.) are less likely to be accepted.</p>
			<p>When you submit your talk, you should indicate whether there will be code in your slides or not. If you are going to perform live coding, please state that as well.</p>

		<div class="section-content">
			<p>JavaZone is proud to be an independent and community-driven conference. It is organized by javaBin, the idealistic and non-profit Norwegian Java User Group. This means that we have three important principles for selecting talks</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We do not sell speaker slots.</li>
				<li>We do not accept sales pitches masked as presentations</li>
				<li>We do not differentiat between speakers from partners and independent speakers</li>
			</ul>
