    <h2 class="first"><i class="icon-hand-right"></i> The Call for Speakers for JavaZone 2014 is now open.</h2>

    <p class="ingress">JavaZone takes place in Oslo, Norway, on September 9th-11th 2014. The conference offers a combination of technical talks and panels in an informal atmosphere with an expected attendance of more than 2000. JavaZone 2014 will be the thirteenth consecutive JavaZone conference.</p>

    <p>As in previous years, last year's conference was a massive success, with software professionals and partners enjoying more than 100 sessions covering multiple topics, and an impressive lineup of internationally known speakers. Leading evangelists in the community rate JavaZone as one of the most important Java events in Europe. Videos from previous years are available at http://vimeo.com/javazone/videos and the program at http://bit.ly/jz12sessions. As in previous years we need your help to recreate the succsess.</p>

    <p>The JavaZone conference is organized by javaBin, the Norwegian Java User Group (JUG). JavaBin is an idealistic, non-profit organization established in 1996 by a group of Java enthusiasts. The JUG has since evolved to be the leading group for promotion of the Java platform in Scandinavia.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>We do not sell speaker slots!</li>
    <li>We do not differentiate partners!</li>
    <li>We do not accept sales pitches masked as presentations!</li>
    </ul>

<!--     <p>Please indicate the code level in your talk, using the following categories:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No Code</li>
        <li>Code in Slides</li>
        <li>Live Coding</li>
    </ul> -->


    <h2>Format and duration</h2>
    <p>The presentations may be given in two formats, either a 60 minute presentation or a 10 minute lightning talk.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Speakers of accepted presentations will get free admission to the conference. They will also be invited to the speakers dinner and can join us on the JourneyZone.</li>
        <li>Speakers of accepted lightning talks will be invited to the speakers dinner, but have to provide for their own admission to JavaZone.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We are considering double slots for special topics, so if you feel you need more than 60 minutes, please contact us.</p>

    <p>The audience consists mostly of software developers and generally talks should be technical enough that they include code (although that is not a requirement). Talks purely related to practices (agile etc.) are less likely to be accepted.</p>

    <h2>Workshops</h2>
    <p>We will continue the popular workshop concept, both half-day and whole-day workshops on Tuesday September 9th and shorter 2-hour workshops during the conference. The format for the workshops is in-depth, hands-on and interactive.</p>

    <p>Reasons for conducting a workshop can be to promote a product, solution, or technology. You can also promote further training courses, or just spread knowledge.</p>

    <p>You can submit your proposal for workshops at http://www.java.no/submitit</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Call for Speakers opens:     February 7th, 2014</li>

<!--     <h2>JourneyZone</h2>
    <p>We are arranging JourneyZone on the first weekend after JavaZone, September 13th-15th. This is our fourth annual journey to the Norwegian wilds. We would like to invite speakers to explore the Norwegian nature, enjoy the very best of Norwegian food and have a great time together.</p>

    <p>To ensure safety and exclusivity, this journey is limited to 30 participants on a first come, first served basis. JavaZone will subsidize the journey with qualified guides to ensure the best possible experience. Your personal expenses will be around NOK 1500.</p>
    <p>
    More information about the trips destination, departure and arrival times to Oslo will be provided.</p>

    <p>Practical information summarized:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Transport, food, guides and accommodation are arranged and provided.</li>
        <li>The Journey will probably require some hiking skills.</li>
        <li>Your personal expenses are estimated to NOK 1500.</li>
        <li>This will be epic - make your reservation today!</li>
        <li>More detailed information will be provided closer to the conference. For questions and registration get in touch with us at program@java.no</li>
