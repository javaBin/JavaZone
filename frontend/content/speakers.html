			</div>
			<div class="section-content">
				<p>JavaZone 2015 will be the 14th consecutive JavaZone conference and will consist of one day of workshops followed by two days of presentations and (more) workshops. Last year's event was a great success with more than 2500 attendees enjoying 150 talks covering a wide range of topics.  Speakers include both internationally known names and home-grown Norwegian talent.</p>
				<p>Over the last decade, JavaZone has grown to become one of the most important Java events in Europe! You can see for yourself â€“ videos from previous years are available for free at <a href="http://vimeo.com/javazone/videos">Vimeo</a>, and the full program from JavaZone 2014 can be found on <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/program.html">last year's web page</a>.</p>
				<p>We can brag as much as we want but JavaZone would be nothing without all the great speakers. That is why we need your help to make sure that JavaZone 2015 will be at least as awesome as the earlier events. If you think that you have something interesting to share, please <a href="<%= settings.submitit_url %>">submit your talk or workshop</a> by the 20th of April, 2015.</p>

				<h2>Promoted Areas</h2>
				<p>This year we are celebrating 20 years of Java. To mark the occasion, we would like to hear your views on the past and the future of Java. Experiences, good and bad. Reflections on the past, mistakes made. What are your visions and predictions for what is to come? How will Distributed Systems, The Cloud, Microservices and the Internet of Things affect the Java landscape?</p>
				<p>For those new to Java, 20 years of innovation is a lot to catch up with!  Therefore, we also encourage sessions targeted at newcomers. If you are an expert who is good at explaining the basics - common frameworks, techniques, tools - please teach us some Java 101!</p>

		<h1>Format and duration</h1>
		<p>You should pick a suitable format for your talk. Are you giving a quick introduction? Do you need more time to elaborate on your subject?  Or is your topic best taught hands-on? We offer three formats for you to present your material:</p>
		<ul class="cf">
			<li class="format format-lightning">
				<img src="/assets/img/illustrations/foredragstype_lyntale.png" /><br />
				<h2>Lightning talks<br /><span>(10 minutes)</span></h2>
				<p>Are you presenting a great new idea or want to give the audience a teaser for a cool topic? If so, you should strongly consider the lightning talk format.  Note that the 10 minute limit is mandatory!</p>
			</li>
			<li class="format format-presentation">
				<img src="/assets/img/illustrations/foredragstype_foredrag.png" /><br />
				<h2>Presentations<br /><span>(60 minutes)</span></h2>
				<p>Presentations at JavaZone have a length of 60 minutes. This lets you to elaborate on a topic and should leave you time to answer questions. We consider double slots for special topics, so if you feel you need more than 60 minutes, please contact us!</p>
			</li>
			<li class="format format-workshop">
				<img src="/assets/img/illustrations/foredragstype_workshop.png" /><br />
				<h2>Workshops<br /><span>(2, 4 or 8 hours)</span></h2>
				<p>We will continue the popular workshop concept, both half-day and whole-day workshops on Tuesday September 8th and shorter 2-hour workshops during the conference. The format for the workshops is in-depth, hands-on and interactive.</p>

			<h1 class="section-header">Technical level</h1>
			<div class="section-content">
				<p>The audience at JavaZone mostly consists of software developers and in general talks and workshops should be technical enough to include code (although that is not a requirement). Talks purely related to practices (agile etc.) are less likely to be accepted.</p>
				<p>When you submit your talk, you should indicate whether there will be code in your slides or not. If you are going to perform live coding, please state that as well!</p>

			<h1>Important principles</h1>

		<div class="section-content">
			<p>JavaZone is proud to be an independent and community-driven conference. It is organized by <a href="http://www.java.no">javaBin</a>, the idealistic and non-profit Norwegian Java User Group.</p> 
			<p>We have three important principles for selecting talks:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We do not sell speaker slots.</li>
				<li>We do not accept sales pitches masked as presentations.</li>
				<li>We do not differentiate between speakers from partners and independent speakers.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you you agree to these very important principles, we are looking forward to your <a href="<%= settings.submitit_url %>">submission!</a>.
