	<h4>Ratings right after the talk</h4>
	<p>During the conference, we asked all participants to rate the talks using green, yellow and red notes. This is the counted ratings for your talks:</p>

	<div class="paperrating paperrating-green"><%= all.feedback.greenPaperfeedback %></div>
	<div class="paperrating paperrating-yellow"><%= all.feedback.yellowPaperfeedback %></div>
	<div class="paperrating paperrating-red"><%= all.feedback.redPaperfeedback %></div>

	<h4>Ratings given after the conference</h4>

	<p>We also sent out a feedback form to all attendees of JavaZone, asking them to rate the talks using 1 to 3 stars. The feedback-form <a href="/survey.html">can be found here</a>, and are still active, meaning these numbers will update if more people give their feedback.</p>
