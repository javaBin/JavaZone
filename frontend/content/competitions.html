            Competitions during JavaZone<br>
            It's all about the partners in the expo area
        </h2>
        <p class="center">Our partners have a a lot of great competitions at their stands. Please check out all the partner stands during the event to see what they are up to, and maybe win a price or two as well!</p>
        <p class="center">They will announce the winners at their own pace, and we'll summarize the winners here after the conference.</p>

        <p class="centersmall">Price winners incoming…</p>

            Visit the most partners,<br>
            win a Pebble and some cool swag
        </h2>
        <p class="center">At your lanyard, you'll find a card with all our partner's logos. Visit as many partners as possible during the conference, get them to each make a hole in your card (just like the old computer punchcards), and deliver the card to the javaBin stand at the end of the conference. Remember to vote for the best stand at the card as well.</p>
        <p class="center">We'll give out Pebble smart watches as well as some cool JavaZone swag to four winners.</p>

            Game of Codes + code reading + compiling<br>
            That's a JavaZone ticket to you
        </h2>

        <p class="center">The competition we held before JavaZone was announced in a typical geeky fashion: not at all. You really had your work cut out for you if you wanted to participate. In our main JavaZone Movie this year, <a href="/videos.html">Game of Codes – a song of bytes and wire</a>, we included a "scroll" with some cryptic code on it. To confuse you, we made the actors say it was Java code. The most clever of you of cource understood that this was blasphemy, it really was pure Clojure code!</p>

        <div class="illustration ill-javacode"></div>
        <p class="centersmall">The clojure code you had to compile to win</p>

        <p class="center">At the end of the day, some of you compiled it, send an email to foundit@java.no as the running code told you to do, and presto: three of the clever human compilers won a full JavaZone 2014 ticket!</p>
        <p class="center">Congrats to the winners: Anders Furseth, Albrecht Schmidt & Alexander Sagen.</p>
