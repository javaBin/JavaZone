				Elve alver reparerte en blå metallic ringperm på ti dager. Tre kroner måtte en gorilla betale. Det ble stille og kaninen viste hvordan den kule kaninen fungerte. En kjempearaber barberte lydmodulen til egypterene. Pyromanen var grei og uheldig. Den hurtige sofaen traff stiftene med en kriger som snakket over en sort oljekanne.

				Flere sabeltanntigerer tastet da mauren som mistet skiskytteren stakk en elefant over dieseltanken. Plutselig så de 6 astronauter som kom bak fisken. De så en venn som rodde vinglete langt foran en fisk. Alpinisten tatoverte en parykk. Flere orker luktet da ei venninne som barberte en viking mobbet en bjørn bak mikrofonen.

						I have been doing lighting talks three of the last four years attending JavaZone. Doing a lightning talk is much less scary than doing a full hour-long presentation. You get to present your favourite subjects, try out your presentation skills and you get valuable feedback. I encourage anyone to try it!						
					</p>
					<p>
						A great example was Hadi Hariri's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=bcefe952">"Refactoring two Functional"</a>, with a practical approach to how functional programming can be used. In the web development area Brian Sletten's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=c16e1531">"Polymer: Shadow DOMs, Custom Components and the Future of Web"</a> stood out. Polymer is based on new web standards like Shadow DOM, HTML imports, custom elements and Object.observe. The project has come very far in a short time and can, according to Brian, very well be used in web solutions already now.

						A few years had passed since my last participation and JavaZone has a reputation as a good conference. These combined made up a good starting point for me to go to Oslo for some professional input. A well organised event with great food and very good quality talks among the ones I attended.
					</p>
					<p>
						For me one of the most interesting presentations in this year’s JavaZone was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=483e15ab">"I-Tier: Breaking Up The Monolith"</a> by Brian McAllister from Groupon. I especially liked gaining insight in how their architectural decisions was carried out in a large and distributed organisation. I also enjoyed <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=96a5fd40">"Practical Considerations for Micro Service Architectures"</a> by Sam Newman for providing valuable tips and Nathaniel Schutta's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=6038cb37">"Mind the Gap: Architecting UIs in the Era of Diverse Devices"</a> for showing exactly how hard it is to test your apps on the multitude of devices out there.

						JavaZone offers a good opportunity to attend a major IT conference without going abroad. With a large selection of topics to choose from, I usually found at least one presentation I wanted to attend. I especially enjoyed that other JVM languages and Javascript got some focus.
					</p>
					<p>
						My highlight from the conference was Fraser Green and his presentation, <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=9d357858">"Akka in real-time"</a>, where he stressed the importance of thinking about "Domain Driven vs Framework distribution" when designing actor-based systems. The talk also provided some useful tips for using Akka and actors in general. Primarily recommended for those who have some previous experience with Akka. Another favorite was Rafael Winterhalter's <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=38ae33c2">"Understanding Java bytecode"</a>, which gave a good intro to JVM byte code. Although the practical value for everyday Java development perhaps is limited, it is always fun to understand more of what really happens when the code is running!

						JavaZone is to me a kind of industry party where you meet colleagues you haven't seen for a while. It was nice to walk around talking to both known and unknown people. As usual JavaZone had put together a very strong program.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite talks was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=cce167fb">"Continuous Delivery for Architects"</a> by Neal Ford. A very well-organised talk describing many important principles of Continuous delivery and Micro Services at a fairly general level. A must see, if you want a good introduction to the topic. I would also like to highlight a fun and different talk on mathematics that challenges common sense and intuition. The talk has no direct relevance to IT, but it challenges how we look at problems in everyday life and it shows why the most intuitive solutions often are not the right ones: <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=666d19fe">“Kontroversiell matematikk”</a> by Christian Magnus Berg

						As a first-time JavaZone visitor I met a firework of impressions. Kudos to JavaBin for the fantastic format; everything was centered around the show floor, never a long way to the sessions. A very good spread of talks, consistent high quality, some variations in presentation skills, but overall very good.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of my favourite talks was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=483e15ab">"I-Tier: Breaking Up the Monolith"</a> by Brian McCallister. In a delightfully humorous and ironic manner Brian showed us the road that Groupon had travelled, breaking down the monolith to small and manageable subsystems. Lots of good examples of what went bad and what went well. Another favourite was <a href="http://2014.javazone.no/presentation.html?id=9b99aad3">"The Adventurous Developer's guide to Application Servers"</a> by Simon Maple. A really energetic and dynamic talk on selecting application servers. He was passionate and had plenty of good documentation underway, clearly having properly tested the different alternatives, presenting everything in a good way.
