    <h3 class="first"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> About javaBin</h3>
    <p>javaBin is a non-profit, independent organization. The purpose is to promote Java expertise among members, member firms and the market. javaBin is headquartered in Oslo, with subgroups in Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim and in southern Norway. In 2009 the group had over 2,000 members from over 210 companies.</p>
	<p>javaBin arranges monthly meetings for its members. The meetings are a good way to strengthen the Java platform and is a venue for sharing experiences and information in addition to being a social arena that links people across firms and institutions.</p>
    <h3><i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> What is the relationship between JavaZone and javaBin?</h3>
    <p>javaBin is the name of the organization which (among other things) organizes the JavaZone conference every year. This means that members of javaBin get reduced prices on the tickets. It's possible to buy tickets to JavaZone without being a member of javaBin, but we suggest that you <a href="http://java.no/index.html?page=medlemskap">consider a membership in javaBin</a> as well, since that means you get both the benefits of being a member and reduced prices for JavaZone tickets.</p>
